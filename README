This program creates a website to help a student manage their courses. 
The program takes into account the major of the student as well as the coure requirments needed.
This program is implemented in HTML, CSS, and PHP.
This project was done by me at a Hackathon: even though my teammates gave up, I stayed up all night learning new langueges (HTML, CSS, and PHP)
and how to implement them into my project.
My goal was to create an environment for a student that is stylish and user friendly. 
Figuring out the courses you still need can be a stressful experience, this website is to make it as easy and calm as possible.

- This project is still in process to take in more majors and take into account the core classes the student has already taken.

To get it to work:
Go into the right folder in terminal
In terminal: php -S localhost:8000
In browser: http://localhost:8000/hello.php
